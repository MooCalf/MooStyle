        question: "Are the mods safe to download?",

        question: "What types of mods do you create for InZoi?",

      },
      {
        question: "A mod isn't working or I found a bug, what do I do?",
        answer: "Double-check you followed the installation steps on the correct game version first. If it's still broken, send a message below with what happened, any error messages, and a screenshot or video if you have one, that makes it much easier to track down.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often do you update mods?",
        answer: "Mods get updated as needed to stay compatible with new game versions and to fix reported issues. Follow the socials in the footer for update announcements.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know which mods are compatible with each other?",
