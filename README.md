## üîê Comprehensive Authentication & Security Architecture

### Advanced Session Management & Persistence

MooStyle implements a sophisticated authentication system that ensures seamless user experience while maintaining the highest security standards. The platform utilizes a dual-layer authentication approach that combines JWT token-based authentication with comprehensive user data management to provide persistent sessions that survive browser restarts and device changes.

When users successfully authenticate, the system generates a cryptographically secure JWT token that contains essential user information including user ID, username, email address, and role permissions. This token is stored securely in the browser's localStorage with a seven-day expiration period, ensuring that users remain authenticated across multiple sessions without compromising security. The token includes built-in security features such as signature verification and automatic expiration handling that prevent unauthorized access and token manipulation.

The platform also maintains comprehensive user profile data in localStorage, including membership levels, loyalty points, notification preferences, and account status information. This dual-storage approach ensures that users can access their personalized experience immediately upon returning to the platform, while the JWT token handles authentication verification and the user data provides personalized content and preferences.

### Password Security & Reset System

The platform implements industry-leading password security measures that protect user accounts from various attack vectors. All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with 12 rounds of salt, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, user passwords remain protected. The system enforces strict password complexity requirements including minimum length, character diversity, and special character inclusion to prevent weak password usage.

The password reset system represents a sophisticated implementation of secure account recovery that balances security with usability. When users request a password reset, the system generates a cryptographically secure 64-character token using Node.js's crypto module, ensuring that reset tokens cannot be predicted or manipulated. These tokens are stored in the database with a 15-minute expiration window, providing sufficient time for users to complete the reset process while minimizing the security window for potential attacks.

The password reset process includes comprehensive email notifications with professionally designed HTML templates that maintain brand consistency while providing clear instructions for users. The system handles various edge cases including expired tokens, invalid requests, and network failures gracefully, ensuring that users receive appropriate feedback and guidance throughout the process. All password reset attempts are logged for security monitoring and audit purposes.

### Account Lifecycle & Data Management

MooStyle implements an intelligent account lifecycle management system that balances user convenience with system performance and security. The platform maintains detailed user activity tracking that monitors login patterns, account usage, and engagement metrics to provide personalized experiences while maintaining system efficiency.

The system includes an automated account cleanup process that manages inactive accounts according to a comprehensive 4-week inactivity policy. This process includes multiple notification stages that inform users of impending account deletion, providing opportunities for account reactivation and data preservation. The cleanup system is designed to be respectful of user data while maintaining database hygiene and system performance.

User accounts include sophisticated membership level management that automatically adjusts based on user activity and engagement. The platform tracks user points and achievements to determine appropriate membership levels, providing users with clear progression paths and benefits. This gamification system encourages user engagement while providing administrators with valuable insights into user behavior and platform usage patterns.

### Database Structure & Account Management

#### **User Account Lifecycle**

##### **Account Creation**
- New users start with **Bronze** membership level
- Default **0 points**
- Email notifications **disabled** by default
- Account marked as **active**

##### **4-Week Inactivity Policy**
- **Inactive accounts** expire after **4 weeks** of no login activity
- **Automated cleanup** runs weekly (Sundays at 2 AM)
- **Email notifications** sent before account deletion
- **Permanent deletion** of all user data after expiration

##### **Account Cleanup Process**
```javascript
// Automated cron job schedule:
- Daily notifications: 9:00 AM (users expiring soon)
- Weekly cleanup: Sunday 2:00 AM (delete expired accounts)
- 6-hourly checks: Every 6 hours (immediate expirations)
```

#### **Database Collections**

##### **Users Collection**
```javascript
{
  username: String,           // Unique username (3-30 chars)
  email: String,             // Unique email address
  password: String,           // Hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
  role: ['user', 'admin'],    // User role
  isActive: Boolean,          // Account status
  lastLogin: Date,            // Last login timestamp
  points: Number,             // Loyalty points (0+)
  membershipLevel: String,    // Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond
  notificationSettings: {     // Email preferences
    emailNotifications: Boolean
  },
  createdAt: Date,           // Account creation date
  updatedAt: Date            // Last modification date
}
```

##### **Cart Collection**
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId,            // Reference to User
  items: [{                  // Cart items array
    product: ObjectId,       // Product reference
    productData: {           // Snapshot of product data
      id: String,
      name: String,
      author: String,
      description: String,
      image: String,
      category: String,
      tags: [String],
      downloadUrl: String,
      fileSize: Number
    },
    quantity: Number,        // Item quantity (min: 1)
    addedAt: Date           // When item was added
  }],
  lastUpdated: Date,         // Last cart modification
  isActive: Boolean          // Cart status
}
```

#### **Membership System**
- **Bronze**: 0-29 points
- **Silver**: 30-79 points  
- **Gold**: 80-199 points
- **Diamond**: 200+ points

#### **Security Features**

- **Data Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data

### Storage Expiration Timeline

| Storage Type | Duration | What Happens |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **JWT Token** | 7 days | Token expires, user must re-login |
| **User Data** | Until logout | Persists until manual logout or token expiry |
| **Cart Data** | Until logout | Synced with database, persists across sessions |
| **Account** | 4 weeks inactive | Account automatically deleted |

### Manual Session Management

#### **Logout Process**
```javascript
// What happens when you logout:
localStorage.removeItem('token');  // Remove JWT token
localStorage.removeItem('user');   // Remove user data
// Redirect to home page
```

#### **Session Validation**
- **Client-side**: Checks localStorage for token existence
- **Server-side**: Validates JWT signature and expiration
- **API calls**: Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

### Troubleshooting Authentication

#### **Common Issues**
1. **"Still logged in after closing browser"**: Normal behavior - localStorage persists
2. **"Logged out unexpectedly"**: JWT token expired (7 days) or account deleted (4 weeks inactive)
3. **"Can't access admin features"**: User role is 'user', not 'admin'

#### **Solutions**
- **Force logout**: Clear browser localStorage manually
- **Check account status**: Verify account hasn't expired
- **Re-login**: Generate new JWT token
